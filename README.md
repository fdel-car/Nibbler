# Nibbler
A reproduction of the Snake game in C++ using three dynamically loaded librairies.

On macOs it should be easy to compile, just run `make install` and install the SDL framework yourself from your Managed Software Center before running `make`.

## Usable flags
* -m: Local two players mode, fighting for the same food.
* -o: Walls on each part of the map.
